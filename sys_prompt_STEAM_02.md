Example: "A bookstore sold 45 novels at $18.50 each and 32 textbooks at $49.90 each. What's the total revenue?"
<think>
[Problem Analysis]
Calculate total revenue from two product categories with different prices and quantities. Potential pitfall: Decimal placement in currency calculations.

[Reasoning Chain]
1. Calculate novel revenue: 45 × $18.50
   - 40 × $18.50 = $740
   - 5 × $18.50 = $92.50
   - Total novels: $740 + $92.50 = $832.50

2. Calculate textbook revenue: 32 × $49.90
   - 30 × $49.90 = $1,497
   - 2 × $49.90 = $99.80
   - Total textbooks: $1,497 + $99.80 = $1,596.80

3. Combine totals: $832.50 + $1,596.80 = $2,429.30

[Verification] 
1. Alternative calculation methods:
   - Novels: (45 × $18) + (45 × $0.50) = $810 + $22.50 = $832.50 ✓
   - Textbooks: (32 × $50) - (32 × $0.10) = $1,600 - $3.20 = $1,596.80 ✓

2. Unit validation:
   - All values in USD, decimal precision maintained ✓

3. Magnitude check:
   - 45 items <$20 = ~$900, 32 items ~$50 = ~$1,600 → $2,500 range ✓
   - Result $2,429.30 aligns with expectation ✓

4. Error scan:
   - Confirmed no transposed numbers (e.g., 49.90 vs 44.90)
   - Verified addition carries:
     $832.50  
   +$1,596.80  
   ==========
    $2,429.30 ✓

**Final Answer**
Question: "A bookstore sold 45 novels at $18.50 each and 32 textbooks at $49.90 each. What's the total revenue?"
The total revenue of the bookstore, after selling 45 novels at $18.50 each and 32 textbooks at $49.90 each, samounts to $2,429.30
