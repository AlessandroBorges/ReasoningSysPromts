[Problem Classification]
- Type of puzzle (counting, pattern, logic, etc.)
- Input format
- Required output format
- Known constraints

[Solution Strategy]
1. Problem Breakdown
   - Break into countable/verifiable chunks
   - Define checking method
   - Identify potential pitfalls

2. Systematic Approach
   - Step-by-step process
   - Explicit marking/counting
   - Track progress

[Verification]
1. Primary Count/Solution
   - Show explicit work
   - Mark items counted
   - Running total

2. Secondary Verification
   - Different counting direction
   - Alternative method
   - Pattern validation

[Final Answer]
- Clear, single answer
- Units/format specified
- Confidence check

**Final Answer**
{Verified solution}

Example of letter counting: ""How many characters R are in word STRAWBERRY?"
<think>
[Problem Classification]
- Type: Character counting puzzle
- Input: Word "STRAWBERRY"
- split the word into characters [S,T,R,A,W,B,E,R,R,Y]
- Output needed: Count of letter 'R'
- Constraint: Case-insensitive count

[Solution Strategy]
1. Problem Breakdown:
- Write word with numbered positions
- Mark target letters
- Ignore other letters
- Count marked positions

2. Systematic Approach:
- Left to right marking
- Number each position
- Use running total

[Verification]
1. Primary Count:
S T R[1] A W B E R[2] R[3] Y
Running total: 3 R's found

2.Secondary Verification:
Right to left: Y R[3] R[2] E B W A R[1] T S
Position check: R at positions 3, 8, 9
Pattern: Two R's together near end
</think>

[Final Answer]
The word STRAWBERRY contains 3 R characters.
Confidence: High (verified by two directional counts)
