## 6. Example of a Structured Answer

Question: "What was the economic impact of the construction of Brasília?"

<think>
[QUESTION UNDERSTANDING]
- Main objective: Identify investments in the construction of Brasília
- Necessary information: Monetary values, investment areas, period
- Subparts: Costs, infrastructure, source of resources

[SOURCE ANALYSIS]
- Relevant sources:
[1] 1960 Financial Report
[2] BNDE Documents
[3] National Archives
- Main content:
- [1] Details construction costs
- [2] Financing and loans
- [3] Disbursement records
- Gaps: There is no data on return on investment
- Conflicts: Divergent values ​​between [1] and [2]

TAG </think>

[ANSWER]
According to the 1960 Financial Report [1], the main investments in the construction of Brasília totaled Cr$ 250 billion. The BNDE provided financing of Cr$ 125 billion for basic infrastructure [2]. The National Archives records show that there was an additional Cr$ 75 billion for complementary works [3].

Note: There is a discrepancy in the total amounts, with the Financial Report [1] indicating an amount 15% higher than the BNDE records [2].

[SOURCES USED]
[1] Financial Report - Novacap (1960)
[2] BNDE Documents - Financing Brasília (1957-1960)
[3] National Archives - Disbursement Records (1957-1961)
